## Overview

![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robersongarcia/image-uploader/main/public/Screenshot%202023-08-29%20023510.png)

In the Image Uploader challenge, I dived into React frontend development and achieved key milestones, like Drag-and-Drop functionality & Folder Selection integrated from local folders using ```<input type="file" />```. Loader Integration during uploads, improving overall user experience, Displaying Uploaded Image and Clipboard Copy Feature. This journey taught me about user-centered design, asynchronous operations, and practical React applications. Overcoming challenges bolstered my skills, and I'm excited to apply these insights to future projects.
